Welcome Fellow Ottawanians!
This application was made to inform the people of Ottawa about the current temperature in our Great White City.
If you're like me in any way, you probably like to know if it's 30 below out there before embarking on a great journey of walking outside in the freezing cold. In about 3 seconds (depending on your internet connection) this application will inform you on the current temperature in Ottawa and will allow you to make decisions like:
1. Should I wear my mitts and gloves?
2. Should I warm up the car before leaving?
3. Should I take my polar bear to work today?
4. Is it even worth it to leave my igloo for work?
5. Will I be able to walk from Tabaret to SITE?
6. Will I freeze while I wait for the next 95?
Well with this application all these questions and much more will be answered!
